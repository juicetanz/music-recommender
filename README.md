# A Content-Based Filtering Approach to Music Recommendation

*Abstract*â€” Large music platforms often recommend new songs based on what similar users listen to. This collaborative filtering method used by companies such as Spotify differs from my approach. I developed a recommendation system which uses the trained model to find the energy of new songs and choose the song most similar to one a user recently listened to. I created a machine learning model with a supervised convolutional neural network to measure the energy, or general activity level, of songs. I trained the model with the waveform images of song audio files labeled with energy levels. My approach can be beneficial in giving users songs that are from genres outside of their usual listening habits, but similar in other ways, or used more holistically via together with a collaborative filtering system.
